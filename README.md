# Intro to Express
This repository contains an introduction to using the Node.js web application framework Express. I'm creating this in preparation for a presentation I'll be doing in December 2017 for the [Western MA Development Technology User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Western-Mass-Development-Technology-Users-Group/).

It's still very much WIP. Don't mind the TODOs.

### Environment setup
- Install Node.js and npm (included)
  - Installs globally (PATH) for convenience
- Use any text editor of your choice. Having a debugger is nice but optional.
  - Node.js debugging is supported out-of-the-box by VSCode.
  - There's the [Node.js Tools extension for Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/node-js/).
  - Or use `node inspect` if you're hardcore.

### Running the code samples
1. Clone this repository
1. Run `npm install` from this directory
1. Run `node <filename>` from within any of the numbered subdirectories (e.g. `node hello-world`)
   - If you're using VSCode, just open any code sample file and press F5 to start debugging
