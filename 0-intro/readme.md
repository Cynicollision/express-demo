# Introduction
The tutorials and code samples within this repository provide an introduction to creating web application using Node.js,  Express, and the ecosystem of open source software that power them. 

For the most part the topics involve building the "App" box in the MEAN stack diagram below:

### Prerequisites
This "course" is intended to be beginner-level. At least some experience or exposure in the following areas will be helpful but expertise is by no means required:
- JavaScript ES2015 syntax, how callback functions work
- Client/server application design, particularly using HTTP

### Disclaimer
I've put this repository together in preparation for a talk I'll be presenting this coming December 2017. I can't promise that I'll keep it up to date. Please feel free to submit an issue if you find anything that can be improved. Pull requests are welcome too!
